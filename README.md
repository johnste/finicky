Finicky is a macOS application that allows you to set up rules that decide which browser is opened for every link or url. With Finicky as your default browser, you can tell it to open Facebook or Reddit in one browser, and Trello or LinkedIn in another.

- Decide what urls to open in what browser or app
- Edit urls before opening them
- Complete control over configuration using JavaScript

## Getting started

Download from [releases](https://github.com/johnste/finicky/releases)

Finicky 3.4.0 is the latest stable release and should work for most use cases. Finicky 4 is under active development and available as prereleases. Note that these releases are actively being developed and can prove to be unstable and may contain bugs.

Finicky 4+ should work in MacOS 12+

## Example configuration

```js
// ~/.finicky.js
export default {
  defaultBrowser: "Google Chrome",
  rewrite: [
    {
      // Redirect all urls to use https
      match: (url) => url.protocol === "http:",
      url: (url) => {
        url.protocol = "https:";
        return url;
      },
    },
  ],
  handlers: [
    {
      // Open apple.com and example.com urls in Safari
      match: ["apple.com*", "example.com*"],
      browser: "Safari",
    },
    {
      // Open any url that includes the string "workplace" in Firefox
      match: /workplace/,
      browser: "Firefox",
    },
    {
      // Open google.com and *.google.com urls in Google Chrome
      match: [
        "google.com*", // match google.com urls
        "*.google.com*", // match google.com subdomains
      ],
      browser: "Google Chrome",
    },
  ],
};
```
